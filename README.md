# Web-Information-Management-Projects
This repository contains the projects done as part of the CS246 course at UCLA

Project 1 : 
In this project, I use Elasticsearch, a popular open-source text search engine, to index a Wikipedia dataset and to enable keyword searches on the dataset. Various text transformations are also applied to the dataset and the effect of the transformations in search results are observed.

Project 2 :
This project is about the use of ranking functions (also called Similarity Functions) in Elasticsearch to sort documents that match a certain query according to their relevance.

Project 3 :
Many users find that a spell checker is a tool that they cannot live without; they mostly know how to spell, but once in a while they experience a time when the correct spelling simply slips their mind. With the help of a spell checker, the search engine tries to guess the user's intention and recommends what is likely to be the correct spelling of whatever the user typed. In this project different ways of implementing a basic spell checker are explored.

Project 4 :
The primary goal of this project is to learn how to use common software tools to run two important theoretical methods: (1) low-rank matrix approximation and (2) latent dirichlet analysis. In Task 1, I perform a rank-k approximation of a matrix using Python. In Task 2, I perform LDA using MALLET.
